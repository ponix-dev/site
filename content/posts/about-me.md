# Welcome! 🌱🐟💻

Hi, I'm Simon Rall. I write software for a living. In my free time, I do a lot of gardening and playing with aquaponics. I am hoping to find where those two worlds meet.

## What You'll Find Here

- My aquaponics experiences
- Garden updates
- Software projects supporting these endeavors

Looking forward to sharing my journey with you!
